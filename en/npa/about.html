      <h2>Validity of the collective agreement between NPA and the State Police</h2>

      <p>
        NPA informs that the <strong>collective agreement between NPA and the State Police,
        signed on 19 October 2006, is still in force</strong>, despite the State Police’s claims to the contrary.
      </p>

      <p>
        In accordance with Articles 19 and 20 of the Labour Law, the provisions of a collective agreement:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>remain in force automatically if no new collective agreement has been concluded;</li>
        <li>continue to be binding on the parties even after the original term has expired;</li>
        <li>cannot be terminated unilaterally.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Since <strong>no new collective agreement has been concluded</strong>, the 2006 agreement
        continues to be fully applicable.
      </p>

      <h2>Police officers and trade unions</h2>

      <p>
        Police officers, including <strong>officials with special service ranks</strong>,
        have the right to join trade unions and to be represented by them in employment,
        social and legal matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        ILO Convention No. 98 allows exceptions for certain state structures, however Latvia
        <strong>has not introduced restrictions on police officers’ right to join a trade union</strong>.
        Therefore, the rights and guarantees provided by the collective agreement apply both
        to employees working under employment contracts and to officials with special service ranks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Disciplinary practice</h2>

      <p>The State Police is obliged to follow a certain disciplinary practice, which includes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the involvement of a trade union representative in disciplinary proceedings concerning officials with special service ranks;</li>
        <li>compliance with the procedures laid down in the collective agreement and laws before any sanctions are applied;</li>
        <li>the possibility to challenge any actions that do not comply with the collective agreement
            or are not coordinated with the trade union.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        NPA emphasises that police officers have the right to legally correct, transparent and
        law-compliant treatment in employment and disciplinary matters.
